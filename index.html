                        <h2>What is Visionary Art?</h2>
	                    <p>"Visionary art as defined for the purposes of the American Visionary Art Museum refers to art produced by self-taught individuals, usually without formal training, whose works arise from an innate personal vision that revels foremost in the creative act itself."</p>
                        <p>In short, visionary art begins by listening to the inner voices of the soul, and often may not even be thought of as 'art' by its creator.</p>
                        <h3>How is visionary art different from folk art?</h3>
	                    <p>The German origin of the word "folk," or volk, suggests "of the people." The term "folk art" can be applied in the broadest sense: it's art of or by the people. At AVAM, we don't define visionary art as "folk art," or even "contemporary folk art," principally because organizations like the National Endowment for the Arts rightfully define folk art as art coming out of a specifically identifiable tradition. Folk art is "learned at the knee" and passed from generation to generation, or through established cultural community traditions, like Hopi Native Americans making Kachina dolls, sailors making macramé, and the Amish making hex signs. The "contemporary folk art" label isn't appropriate for AVAM either, since we like to show works created by self-taught artists who may have lived hundreds of years ago, alongside work that may have been created last year. The exhibition themes we choose to explore are, thus, innately timeless -with the power to inspire human beings in highly personal acts of creation. Unlike folk art, visionary art is entirely spontaneous and individualized.</p>
                        <h3>So when is visionary art clearly not folk art?</h3>
	                    <p>The essential difference between the two, though both may at times use similar materials and methods, is that visionary artists don't listen to anyone else's traditions. They invent their own. They hear their own inner voice so resoundingly that they may not even think of what they do as 'art.' Dubuffet's beloved Art Brut Collections, formed exclusively from the "raw art" creations of non-artists, such as street people, hermits, factory workers, housewives and psychic mediums, motivated him to say: "Art is at its best when it forgets its very name." It is this listening to one's inner voice with such focused attention that contributes to the unusually large number of visionary artworks, many of which took decades to create. Yet there are still common threads. The most common theme of visionary artists worldwide is the backyard recreation of the Garden of Eden and other utopian visions – quite literally building heaven on earth.</p>
                        <h3>Can't trained artists also hear their own voices?</h3>
	                    <p>Absolutely. All of us at AVAM enjoy and respect the learning that comes from academic study or through apprenticeship to a trained artist. We dedicate AVAM exclusively, however, as a place devoted to the other path of mastery – the intuitive path of learning to listen to the small, soft voice within. We believe there is great power in not knowing what will or won't work, and we adhere to the importance of not being immersed in rule-based systems which can cloud one's vision. As in science, ignorance often gives birth to genuinely new inventions and a re-examination of what has already been dismissed. Jonathan Swift defined this kind of vision so perfectly: "Vision is the art of seeing things invisible." Discovering possibilities that others do not see is what visionaries do best.</p>
                        <h3>How do you find all these works you exhibit? Who gets to pick?</h3>
                        <p>We are committed to unveiling a great range of the best of visionary art by exploring one unifying theme at a time. We seek out individual guest curators who know, respect, and adore visionary art and who are likely to have their own special relationship with a particular exhibition theme. We like them to lead a full life quite apart from their curatorial abilities, so that their personal richness and other interests can influence their show.

						<p><i>National Aquarium is a nonprofit organization whose mission is to inspire conservation of the world’s aquatic treasures.</i></p>
						<p>Originally established in 1873 in Wood’s Hole, Massachusetts, National Aquarium, Washington, DC, was considered the nation’s first public aquarium. In 1878, the National Aquarium moved to the site of the Washington Monument, and in 1932, the Aquarium was incorporated into the lower level of the Commerce Building. Federal funds were eliminated from the operating budget for the National Aquarium, Washington, DC, in 1982. Threatened with closing, the National Aquarium Society was formed to keep the Aquarium open.</p>
						<p>Meanwhile, during the 1970s, then-Baltimore Mayor William Donald Schaefer conceived and championed the idea of an aquarium as a vital component in the redevelopment of Baltimore's Inner Harbor. In 1976, Baltimore City residents voted on a bond referendum in favor of building the National Aquarium, Baltimore. Groundbreaking for the facility took place on August 8, 1978. In 1979, the new aquarium was recognized by the United States Congress, which granted the facility "national" status. The National Aquarium, Baltimore, opened to the public on August 8, 1981.</p>
						<p>In 2003, the National Aquarium Society Board of Directors signed an alliance agreement with the Board of Directors of the National Aquarium, Baltimore, enabling the two aquariums to work together to strengthen the animal collection and educational impact of the National Aquarium.On September 30, 2013, National Aquarium, Washington, DC, closed its doors to the public, due to necessary renovations in the Department of Commerce.</p>
						<p>Today, the National Aquarium, Baltimore, features a living collection of more than 17,000 fish, birds, amphibians, reptiles and marine mammals living in award-winning habitats. In summer 2013, the Aquarium opened Blacktip Reef, a breathtaking exhibit replicating an Indo-Pacific reef and featuring more than 700 animals, including a school of blacktip reef sharks.</p>

						<p>The legendary Hippodrome Theatre opened on November 23, 1914 and, for over 70 years, served as a movie palace that also showcased some of the top vaudeville performances of the time. It shuttered briefly and reopened with stunning renovation in 2004 as The France-Merrick Performing Arts Center and continues to provide world-class entertainment to downtown Baltimore ever since as the crown jewel of the newly established Bromo Tower Arts & Entertainment District.
 </p>
                        <h2>History of the Hippodrome</h2>
						<p>The legendary Hippodrome Theatre was designed by noted theatre architect Thomas Lamb for exhibitors Pearce and Scheck. It was constructed on the site of the old Eutaw House, a luxury hotel built in 1835. The Hippodrome Theatre opened on November 23, 1914 as a movie palace that also showcased vaudeville performances. The theatre seated 3,000 and in 1920 the average weekly attendance was 30,000. Sound for the movies was provided by piano, a Moller organ commissioned for the theatre, and an orchestra. The Hippodrome Theatre was part of the Loew's Theatre chain from 1917 until 1924, when it became part of the Keith chain. New management in 1931 installed a huge new marquee and other facelift items such as new seats. In 1931 the Hippodrome had 3 price levels - 25 cents before noon, 35 cents between noon and 6pm, and 50 cents after 6pm.</p>
                        <p>Under the management of Isidor M. Rappaport, which began in 1931, the Hippodrome Theatre gained a reputation as a top vaudeville house, presenting such notables as Bob Hope, Jack Benny, Red Skelton, Benny Goodman and his orchestra, Dinah Shore, Martha Raye, Milton Berle, the Andrews Sisters and Morey Amsterdam during Rappaport’s 30-year tenure. It was in The Hippodrome that Frank Sinatra first appeared with the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra and in 1939 with Harry James’ band. Movies were combined with vaudeville entertainment through 1950. The Hippodrome Theatre was one of the first stages to present Vaudeville and motion pictures and maintained a house orchestra at the theatre well into the 1950's.</p>
                        <p>Business remained strong from the 1930’s through the 1950’s with the last stage shows presented around 1959. Another major renovation occurred in 1963 in preparation for the regional premiere of “Cleopatra”. In 1969 the Hippodrome Theatre was the site of the world premiere of “Slaves.” Business dropped off during the 70’s and 80’s, and the Hippodrome Theatre closed in 1990, when it was the last operating movie theatre in downtown Baltimore.</p>
                        <p>The curtain rose again in 2004 on the Hippodrome Theatre at The France-Merrick Performing Arts Center. This was the culmination of a construction and restoration project that transformed and combined three significant historic buildings and one newly constructed building into a state-of-the-art showcase. These landmarks are the Western National Bank (built in 1887), the Eutaw Savings Bank (built in 1888), the Hippodrome Theatre, and a new building at the corner of Baltimore and Eutaw Streets. Programming at this world-class venue includes touring Broadway shows, dance, music, comedy and all the best artists throughout the performing arts.</p>

						<p>When Oriole Park at Camden Yards opened on April 6, 1992, a new era of Major League Baseball began. The park was brand new, but still old-fashioned. State-of-the-art, yet quaint. At less than a day old, it was already a classic.</p>
						<p>Oriole Park at Camden Yards inspired a generation of ballpark construction. No longer would communities across America build multipurpose stadiums devoid of character, surrounded by vast parking lots. Ballparks would now be created to nestle neatly into existing and historic neighborhoods and play key roles in the revitalization of urban America.</p>
						<p>Oriole Park at Camden Yards captured the nation's attention from day one and in the 20 seasons that followed, has served as the standard by which all new ballparks are measured. Citizens of Baltimore and all of Maryland, as well as Orioles fans throughout Birdland, should take great pride in the fact that our team makes its home in the ballpark that forever changed baseball.</p>
